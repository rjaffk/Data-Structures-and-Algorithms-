1. huge_fibonacchi_number_modulo_m.cpp
In this problem, your goal is to compute 𝐹𝑛 modulo 𝑚, where 𝑛 may be really huge: up to 10^18
Task. Given two integers 𝑛 and 𝑚, output 𝐹𝑛 mod 𝑚 (that is, the remainder of 𝐹𝑛 when divided by 𝑚).
Input Format. The input consists of two integers 𝑛 and 𝑚 given on the same line (separated by a space).
Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 10^5
Output Format. Output 𝐹𝑛 mod 𝑚.
